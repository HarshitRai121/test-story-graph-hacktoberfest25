# ✨ Once Upon a Commit: Infinite Pages ✨

> “Some books are written by one author.  
> This one is written by everyone.”

Welcome, traveler. 🌍  
This is not just a repository. This is a **living constellation of stories** — a book that has been waiting for years for you to write it.  

Every contributor adds a **story node**, a chapter that continues the journey.  
Together, we weave a tale of wanderers, bridges, choices, and lessons — a book that grows like a constellation, star by star, commit by commit.  

At the end of Hacktoberfest 2025, all the nodes will become a **published digital book**, and every contributor will be remembered as a co-author of *Infinite Pages*.

## 🌟 The Story Format

Our story is written in the spirit of *The Alchemist* — simple, symbolic, emotional.

- **Central Themes**:  
  Dreams • Self-Discovery • Courage • Hope • Lessons of the Soul

- **Recurring Archetypes**:  
  - The Wanderer → seeker of truth  
  - The Elder / Mentor → wisdom and guidance  
  - The Crow → doubt and fear  
  - The Bridge / Shards → choices and destiny  

- **Each Node Must Have**:
  - A **title**
  - The **author’s GitHub username**
  - A **parent chapter** (the file you continue from)
  - A **lesson learned** (the wisdom your chapter imparts)
  - A **passing the torch** (the other contributor gets the idea about the next flow) 


Example:

```

title: The Mountain of Shards
author: contributor4
parent: chapter02_stars.md
---

The Wanderer followed the path of falling stars until it led them to a mountain.  
Its peak touched the heavens, its slopes glittering with fragments of broken constellations.  
Each shard pulsed faintly, humming like heartbeats buried in stone.  

The climb was steep.  
With every step, the Wanderer’s lantern flickered — sometimes strong, sometimes weak, as though the mountain tested their resolve.  

At one point, they stumbled.  
A shard cut their hand, drawing blood.  
Yet when their blood touched the shard, it glowed brighter and fused into the lantern’s flame.  

The Wanderer understood:  
The shards were not gifts to be taken.  
They were burdens to be earned, each demanding sacrifice.  

At last, near the summit, the Wanderer found a massive shard unlike the rest — it glowed with a warmth that felt like a heartbeat.  
When they reached for it, the shard dissolved into their chest.  
The lantern blazed so brightly it painted the sky with fire.  

The mountain whispered:  
*"Every wound you carry becomes light for the road ahead."*  

**Lesson**: Pain endured can become strength shared.

🔮 **Passing the Torch**  
At the summit, the Wanderer saw the horizon split into three — a forest, a river, and a ruined city lit faintly by sparks.  
Each shimmered with possibility.
