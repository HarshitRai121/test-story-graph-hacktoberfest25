# ✨ Once Upon a Commit: Infinite Pages ✨

> “Some books are written by one author.  
> This one is written by everyone.”

Welcome, traveler. 🌍  
This is not just a repository. This is a **living constellation of stories** — a book that has been waiting for years for you to write it.  

Every contributor adds a **story node**, a chapter that continues the journey.  
Together, we weave a tale of wanderers, bridges, choices, and lessons — a book that grows like a constellation, star by star, commit by commit.  

At the end of Hacktoberfest 2025, all the nodes will become a **published digital book**, and every contributor will be remembered as a co-author of *Infinite Pages*.

## 🌟 The Story Format

Our story is written in the spirit of *The Alchemist* — simple, symbolic, emotional.

- **Central Themes**:  
  Dreams • Self-Discovery • Courage • Hope • Lessons of the Soul

- **Recurring Archetypes**:  
  - The Wanderer → seeker of truth  
  - The Elder / Mentor → wisdom and guidance  
  - The Crow → doubt and fear  
  - The Bridge / Shards → choices and destiny  

- **Each Node Must Have**:
  - A **title**
  - The **author’s GitHub username**
  - A **parent chapter** (the file you continue from)
  - A **lesson learned** (the wisdom your chapter imparts)


Example:

```markdown
---
title: The Mask of Truth
author: your-github-username
parent: chapter04.md
---

Elias asked the warrior to remove their mask.  
Beneath it was a face both young and ancient,  
teaching him that truth cannot hide forever.  

**Lesson**: To face the world, one must first face themselves.
```
