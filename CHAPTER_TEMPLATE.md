✍️ **Your Story**  
(Write your chapter here, around 150–300 words.  
Keep it simple, symbolic, and emotional — like *The Alchemist*.  
Use imagery, metaphors, and lessons of the journey.  
Continue naturally from your chosen parent chapter.)

---

🌟 **Lesson Learned**  
(Write 1–2 lines of wisdom your chapter imparts.  
Example: *“Courage is not the absence of fear, but the will to walk despite it.”*)

---

🔮 **Passing the Torch**  
(End your chapter with openness for the next writer.  
Example: *“Ahead, the path split into two — one glowing with warmth, the other cloaked in mist.”*)
