# Contributing to The Collaborative Chain Novel

Welcome, traveler! This project is a fun, creative way to build a branching story, where your contribution adds a new branch to our collective narrative tree.

## How to Contribute
1.  **Read the Story**: Explore the existing chapters in the `storynodes/` directory. Find a chapter that ends with a clear choice and is a story you'd like to continue.
2.  **Create Your Story Node**: Add a new Markdown file (`.md`) to the `storynodes/` directory. The filename should be thematic and descriptive (e.g., `the-elder-speaks.md`).
3.  **Use the Template**: At the top of your file, include the following metadata.
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: The Elder Speaks
    author: your-github-username
    parent: chapter01.md
    ---
    ```
    *   **title**: The title of your story node.
    *   **author**: Your GitHub username.
    *   **parent**: The filename of the story node you are continuing.
4.  **Write Your Narrative**: Below the metadata, write the content of your story.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request**: When you are ready, submit a Pull Request (PR). Your PR title should be formatted as: `New Story Node: Your Story Title`.

## Review Process
*   **No Vain Efforts**: Since this is a branching novel, we can accept multiple contributions stemming from the same "parent" story node. Every valid contribution adds a new path to the story tree, so no effort is wasted.
*   **Focus on Creativity**: We will review your submission for general formatting and story flow, but creative license is highly encouraged!
